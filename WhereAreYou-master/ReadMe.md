# Where are you?

### Automate tracking and sharing your location with your friends and family.
![Where are you?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelkadia/WhereaAreYou/master/screenshot_1.png)

### Why I made this?
```JSON
{
	"MOM to ME": {
		"on Call": ["Where are you, Neel ?"]
	},
	"Friends to me": {
		"on Whatsapp": ["Wassup, where are you bro?", "Where are you buddy?"],
		"on Messenger": ["Hey, in city?", "Hey, Call me I'm in City, We can meet"],
		"on Call": ["I'm at your Home, F*ck! where the hell are you?"]
	}
}
```
People kept asking me "Where are you Neel?!" constantly while I was working on a interesting GIF or some in-house project in a college hostel. I had a thought to make something which always track your location and tell these people where you are. That thing must be autonomous, so it won't require your focus at all. So I came up with this.
